All images used for this assignment, with the exception of the self-portrait in the About Us page, were used from Unsplash.

The bread logo was used from the Canva collection, and the brand name was made in Adobe Illustrator.

Since my low-fi mockups were for a Homepage, I chose to use them as inspiration for the other pages. Please ignore the two circles on the image as they were for last semester's assignment, not this one.
